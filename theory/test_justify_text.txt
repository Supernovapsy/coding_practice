In mathematics management science economics computer science and bioinformatics dynamic programming is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems solving each of those subproblems just once and storing their solutions ideally using a memory based data structure The next time the same subproblem occurs instead of recomputing its solution one simply looks up the previously computed solution thereby saving computation time at the expense of a hopefully modest expenditure in storage space Each of the subproblem solutions is indexed in some way typically based on the values of its input parameters so as to facilitate its lookup The technique of storing solutions to subproblems instead of recomputing them is called memoization
